	// 3. {17, 2, 5, 6, 8, 11} --> It will scan twice, one for ordering ('17' will be carried over all the way to the end in one scan.), one for confirmation.
	// 4. {5, 6, 8, 11, 17, 2} --> (w.c.s.) It will scan six times, five for ordering, one for confirmation.
	// 5. {17, 11, 8, 6, 5, 2} --> (w.c.s.) It will scan six times, five for ordering, one for confirmation.
	// 6. If array size is 10, (w.c.s.) how many times the comparison has to happen? 10 scans and 9 comparison in each scan --> 10*9 -> 90 --> ~10*10
	// 7. If array size is 100, (w.c.s.) how many times the comparison has to happen? 100 scans and 99 comparison in each scan --> 100*99 -> 9900 --> ~100*100
	// 8. If array size is n, (w.c.s.) how many times the comparison has to happen? n scans and (n-1) comparison in each scan --> n*(n-1) --> ~n*n (quadratic)
